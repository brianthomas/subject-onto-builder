In order to build a subject ontology from 'scratch' follow
the following steps:

1. Glean a list of subject nodes from the various Registry Resource XML
files, e.g. 

foreach xml (`filedirectory/*.xml`) 
foreach> grep "<subject>" $xml >> subjectlist
foreach> end

2. Clean up the file so that you just have the text of each subject.
In the past it was helpful to add a root xml node, run xmllint --format
to produce a nicely formated file, then use vi editor to remove
all of the <subject></subject> nodes. Probably should write a perl
program to do this..

3. Run the tokenizer and cat the results through sort to get a 
usable subject list, e.g.

> perl tokenizer.pl subjects_raw4 | sort -u > subjects_tokenized

4. Run the subject concept filter, to kick out terms which are unusual
contractions or acronyms

> perl filterconcepts.pl subjects_tokenized > subjects_tokenized_filtered

5. Run the subject onto builder program to autogenerate a flat subject
ontology, e.g.

> perl create_subject_ontology.pl subjects_tokenized_filtered > subject_flat.owl

6. Run the onto merger program with the subject_flat.owl and another 
ontology, e.g. 

> perl merge_ontologies.pl IVOAT.owl subject_flat.owl > subject.owl
